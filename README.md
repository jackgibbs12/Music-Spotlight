# Music Spotlight
Music Spotlight is an an application I am developing to fuse together two of my favourite interests: music and computer science. 

#Languages/Frameworks 
This project uses the Python framework Django. To run this web app locally, you will need to ensure that you have the Django framework installed. To install Django, execute the following command:

python -m pip install django

To ensure that the installation was successful, you can run the following command:

python -m django --version

If Django has successfully been installed, you should see the version of Django installed.

#Run the Project: To set up the migrations and start the Django development server to run the web app, run the following command:

python manage.py runserver

The web app will then be accessible at the following location: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
